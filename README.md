# MyCv

This project was created for the Software Engineering course. The main goal of the project was to provide my CV to the visitors of the page. The visitors are able to see all the necessary information within a CV.

## Technologies
Npm 8.5.0
NodeJs 16.14.2
Angular CLI 13.2.5
## Necessary installation
A development environment (Intellij)
GitBash
Angular
NodeJs
For Intellij, go to the JetBrains website and create an account. Then, download the program based on your operating system. For GitBash, simply go to the website Git-scm and download the program based on your operating system. Once you have installed GitBash, you can open it and enter a command npm install -g @angular/cli. For NodeJs, again, you should go to the Internet and type NodeJs download and choose between different versions depending on your operating system. To check that you have installed NodeJs, you can type in GitBash node -v. If it tells you its version, then you have installed it correctly. Also, you should check the command npm -v.

## Dependencies
Angular Material
## Launch
To run the project, go to GitBash and go to the folder where you want to place the project. Once you are in the folder, type git clone https://github.com/Ismar-Becirspahic/my_cv_frontend.git Then, you need to run a command nmp install. You only have to run this command the first time you clone the project. With the command ng serve, the project will be started.


## Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The project is also hosted by Netlify. Since it is connected to GitHub, any new changes to the project on GitHub will be automatically added to the Netlify site. To navigate to Netlify, go to https://my-cv-se.netlify.app/#/.

## Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

## Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
